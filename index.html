<h2>Fun Facts About Seals</h2>
<P>Seals are social animals that live in large groups called colonies. They often gather on land or sea ice to mate and raise their young. For example, elephant seals are highly social and form large groups called harems during breeding season.
   
    Seals are natural scuba divers because their blood and muscles contain high levels of oxygen-carrying compounds, which help them store oxygen longer than most other animals. They can dive to great depths and stay underwater for up to two hours, and some species can dive as deep as 900 meters.
   
    Seals have a thick layer of fat called blubber under their skin to keep them warm in cold water. Baby seals can gain up to five pounds a day to store fat for this purpose. Their mothers also produce milk that's up to 60% fat to help their pups build up their blubber reserves.
  
    Seals are barrel-shaped with short, wide, flat flippers that are well-suited for their aquatic habitat. They also have lots of whiskers, called vibrissae, that help them find prey in murky or deep water.</P>
